# What is Pelagius?

Pelagius is a Discord bot that was originally written for Evertiro's
[LOTD Plus Skyrim modding guide](https://lotdplus.com). This later expanded to
[Lexy's Legacy of the Dragonborn guide](https://lexyslotd.com) as well as
[The Phoenix Flavour](https://thephoenixflavour.com). Originally, the wasn't
actually a bot at all, just me running a python script manually to compare my
own loadorder to that of other users when they uploaded it. Naturally, the
problem with that is that I have to be there all the time to run my script.
I then decided to start developing a standalone Discord bot written in
Discord.py to accomplish the same thing, but automatically. I later switched
over to Discord.js, as well as implemented a few other features, such as being
able to ignore certain plugins in the list. However, that's the past. Let's talk
about now and the future.

## What does it do?

Basically it lets your users upload a loadorder.txt file and compare it to a
master file.

- Staff upload a "master" loadorder.txt to be compared to (generated by MO2)
- Users can upload a loadorder.txt and it will be analyzed
  - This analysis will tell them what plugins they shouldn't have and what
    they're missing compared to the master list
- Staff can pause and resume validation, useful for updates to the list
- Staff can upload a "skips" file which contains a list of plugins to ignore
- Staff can upload a "reasons" JSON file which is used to tell users why a
  certain plugin is missing or extra
- Properly supports multiple Discord servers, keeping staff lists and master
  files separate
- Supports multiple guides on a single server, and allows a "default" guide

## How do I set it up?

First, click [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=714232981774139442&permissions=100352&scope=bot)
to add Pelagius to your server. Select the server you want to add the bot to,
and ensure that the check boxes for the "Send Messages," "Attach Files," and
"Read Message History" permissions are selected. Finally, click the "Authorize"
button to add the bot to your server.

Once the bot has joined the server, you only need to do one thing: set up a master file

- Get your loadorder.txt ([example](example/loadorder.txt)) (generated by MO2)
  and upload it with the command `/manage file upload loadorder`

That's it, Pelagius is ready to run!

If you want, you can also upload a "skips" and "reasons" file using the command
`/manage file upload [filetype]`.

- The skips file ([example](example/skips.txt)) will ignore all listed filenames
  (files should be entered one per line)
- The reasons file ([example](example/reasons.json)) will provide reasons to
  your users as to why they shouldn't have a certain file (it needs to be JSON)

# Complete command list

## /loadorder

The `/loadorder` command requires one argument, an attachment. This attached file must be named `loadorder.txt`. There is an optional `guide` argument, to specify what guide to compare your loadorder against. By default, this command can be run by any user.

## /guides

The `/guides` command lists the guides that are available in the server, as well as stating the default guide. If no guide argument is sent in a command, it will use the default guide. By default, this command can be run by any user. 

## /manage

The `/manage` command is the hub command for managing Pelagius as a staff member. By default, members with the Manage Server permission can use these commands.

### /manage file

The `/manage file` subcommand group is for managing your files. You can upload new files with `/manage file upload`, or retrieve existing files with `/manage file retrieve`. You must specify what type of file, and may optionally provide a guide to set the files for.

### /manage guide

The `/manage guide` subcommand group is for managing separate guides within your server. You may `add`, `remove`, `rename`, and `list` guides easily. `/manage guide default` will control what guide is the default for your server. `/manage guide enable` will control if validation is enabled for a specific guide or not.

If you ever wish to change permissions on a command, go to your `Server Settings -> Integrations -> Pelagius` and see the command settings there. You may also use this area to control which channels the commands can be run in.
